This is an R Markdown document (`.Rmd`). Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown I recommend **Bookdown** by *Yihui Xie*  <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html>.

Above this text there is some code surrounded by "---" which sets up the document. There, you can set defaults and formatting for the document output. The two requirements you need are a title and an output type, all the rest are formatting options. 

Text (here) is written in Pandoc's Markdown syntax. Here you can document information about your datasets, references, notes, ideas, explanations, heck, even write the body of your manuscript! It can all be formatted nicely in-line. Here are some helpful formatting tips from bookdown:  

# Formatting

## In-line text
+ When you end a paragraph, write 2 spaces. Otherwise, all your text will be in one big string. 
+ Leave a blank line between text paragraphs and in-line foramtting like equations, lists and tables. It makes your code look neater and ensures R reads formatting correctly
+ Italic text if surrounded by underscores or asterisks, e.g., _text_ or *text*  
+ Bold text is produced using a pair of double asterisks (**text**)  
+ A pair of tildes (~) turn text to a subscript (e.g., H~3~PO~4~ renders H3PO4)  
+ A pair of carets (^) produce a superscript (e.g., Cu^2+^ renders Cu2+)  

## Lists
Unordered list items (like above) start with *, -, or +, and you can nest one list within another list by indenting the sub-list  

- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one more item
    - one more item
    - one more item

Ordered list items start with numbers (you can also nest lists within lists), e.g.,  

1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item


## Headings
### This is a slightly smaller heading!
#### Even smaller heading!
##### Does it keep going?
###### OMG how far does it go?
####### Its headings all the way down!!!

## Equations
If you have any equations you need to remember for your methods, you can write them as text here between dollar signs:  

$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$  

# Chunks
Chunks are where the magic happens. Ie. where you import data, mess with it, code, calculate, make figures, etc. By default, the code chunk will appear in the html document (echo = TRUE), but you can hide code chunks that your collaborators don't need to see (ie. messy background code). The best part about chunks is that you can run a chunk all at once instead of line by line by pressing the green arrow. If your code is broken, the chunk wont run and you have to fix it! Tough but fair. Below is a simple chunk with a single command within:  

```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r clean space, echo = FALSE}
# always start off with a clean slate....then mess it up
# echo = FALSE hides the code
rm(list = ls())
```

```{r load packages, warning = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
library(dplyr) # or the tidyverse package
library(colorspace) # i love this package for vision-diverse friendly colour palletes
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr) #for multiplots
library(gtsummary) # for summary tables
library(kableExtra) # for basic tables

# warning = FALSE hides the warnings from the html output
```

## Data
Here, we will import a dummy dataset (mine, lol), clean it up a bit, and show a quick summary of the data. Useful for first step data validation in a pinch. 
```{r datasets, warning = FALSE}
df <- read.csv("salpref_smoltdata_20102020.csv")
# Rmarkdown is handy to annotate any changes you make to datasets. I like it because a broken script will not knit so youre forced to deal with problems as they arrise. 

# rename columns to be more succinct and coding friendly
df <- df %>%
  dplyr::select(-X) %>% # remove unneccessary columns
                        # note, if you get an error with a pipe in dplyr, sometimes its due to conflict with plyr, so you have to either unload plyr or specify that the package you want is dplyr
  dplyr::rename(fish.id = Fish_ID,
         experiment = Experiment,# rename works as NEW = OLD
         outmigr.wk = OutMigration_Week, 
         outmigr.day = Days_Since_Outmigr, 
         fl = Field_FL_mm, # also make sure you have documentation of your units somewhere (like here!) if you remove them from your column names
         mass = Field_Weight_g, 
         k = Fulton_K, 
         explore = Active, # exploratory = 1, non-exploratory = 0
         pref = Preferred_Chamber_p0.5) # salinity of preferred chamber

# change variables to factor
df <- df %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(outmigr.wk, explore), funs(factor))

# order salinity preference
df$pref <- factor(df$pref, levels = c("Freshwater", "Brackish", "Saltwater"))

#show summary of dataframe
summary(df)
```

## Figures

```{r single fig, fig.cap= "Figure 1. Fish Condition by Outmigration Week", out.width= '50%', fig.align='center'}
# fig.cap adds a figure caption just to the html file after you knit it
# out.width scales your figures, if you are doing a multipanel just to present in the html, make it 50% so that its 2 columns. This wont save the figure, just show it. To save a multiplot, use the code below

margins <- c(0.5,0.5,0.5,1.1) # set ur margins to publ. standard. This is a good staple. 

f1 <- ggplot(df, aes(outmigr.wk, k, fill = pref))+
  geom_point(position=position_dodge(width=0.75), aes(group=pref))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_fill_discrete_sequential(palette = "BluGrn") +
  labs(title = "Composite",
       fill = "Preference",
       y = expression(bold(Fulton~K~"("~g~"*"~mm^{"-3"}~")")), 
       x = "\n Outmigration Week") + # the 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c('River','Estuary','Ocean')) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(title = element_text(size=14, face = "bold"), 
        axis.text=element_text(size=12, colour="black"),
        legend.position = c(0.9, 0.97),
        axis.title=element_text(size=14, face = "bold"), 
        legend.title =element_text(size=9, colour="black"),
        legend.text =element_text(size=7, colour="black"),
        plot.margin=unit(margins,"line"), 
        strip.text=element_text(hjust=0), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"), #transparent background baaabyyy
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA), 
        axis.text.x = element_text()) 

#show it
print(f1) 

#save it
ggsave("yourfirstfig.jpeg",plot=f1,units="in",height=6,width=8,dpi=800) # you can change the output size and dpi here. This is a good staple. 

# no trend as aggregate data, but we have included both exploratory and non exploratory fish, so lets filter the dataset by that

```


If you want to include a graphic or figure that is not generated from R code, like one you made in Inkscape after Colin's rad workshop, you may use the knitr::include_graphics() function. Here's a cute goat GIF because Wednesday.

## Tables
For more table formatting options, chech out  <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html>  

### Basic
```{r Tables, include = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
#make sure results = 'asis' is there

# use dplyr to group by week, spread by fish behaviour (exploratory or not), and count the number of active fish in each week
df$explore <- dplyr::recode(df$explore, '0'="Non-exploratory", '1' ="Exploratory")
df$outmigr.wk <- dplyr::recode(df$outmigr.wk ,'1'="River", '2' ="Estuary",'4' = "Ocean") # to change grouping name

tab1 <-
  df %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(outmigr.wk, explore) %>%
  dplyr::count(outmigr.wk, explore) %>%
  tidyr::spread(key = explore, value = n ) %>%
  dplyr::rename("Outmigration Week" = outmigr.wk)

#make kable table - output to html, and you can copy paste it directly into word easy peasy
kable(tab1) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered","hover", "condensed", "responsive"), position = "left", full_width = FALSE, fixed_thead = TRUE) # just some nice formatting, you can play around with these

```

```{r Summary Stats Tables, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
#make sure results = 'asis' is there

# select the variables from your dataset that you want to include in your table
tab2 <- df %>% dplyr::select(outmigr.wk, fl, mass, k)


tab2 %>% # your dataset
  #build base summary table 
  tbl_summary(
    #split table by outmigration week
    by=outmigr.wk, 
    #change variable names
    label = list (fl ~ "Fork length (mm)",#now you just write all the variables you want to include and can rename them with units
                  mass ~ "Wet Mass (g)",
                  k ~ "Fulton's K (g/mm^3)"), 
    
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})")) %>% #you can pick the summary stats you want to display
  add_overall() %>%
  add_p(test = list(all_continuous() ~ "aov")) %>% # you can show simple comparative stats here, here one way anova
  as_kable()  %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered","hover", "condensed", "responsive"), position = "left", full_width = FALSE, fixed_thead = TRUE) # just some nice formatting, you can play around with these

```
