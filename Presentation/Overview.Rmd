## Tools we are using

## Rmarkdown

**Markdown (.md extension)**

- Markup language independant of R

- Plain text formatting syntax that can convert to other formats


**Rmarkdown (.Rmd extension)**

- R package (rmarkdown)

- Extension of markdown syntax that enables embedded R code to be executed

- Converts .Rmd files into many formats (**rmarkdown::render**)

##YAML 
- **Y**et **A**nother **M**arkup **L**anguage vs. YAML Ain't Markup Language?
- Metadata at the head of .Rmd files
- Determines format of the final document

##Knitr

- R package (knitr)
- Takes plain text doc with embedded code, executes the code, and "knits" results back into document
- The "engine" that integrates R code into different outputs (e.g., reproducible reports)


##Pandoc
- Command line tool for converting documents independent from R
- Comes bundled with R Studio
- The engine for rmarkdown::render

##Process

(1) A raw .Rmd markup file (text + R code etc.)

(2) knitr::knit is called to execute code in .Rmd

(3) pandoc is called by rmarkdown::render to convert into a new output document

(4) YAML metadata passes options to guide building process and output format

##LaTex

- Standalone software for document preparation (TeX typesetting language)

- Part of pipeline for translating .Rmd files into PDF format
