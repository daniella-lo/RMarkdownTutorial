#Abstract
Salmon smolts are really cool, obviously. However, we also lack a full understanding of why they do what they do. Here we fill in that knowledge gap with some data, which we manipulate, analyze, and display in R markdown. Buckle up...


#Introduction
We will start out broad and reference some important contributions to the literature. For example, you can reference a paper at the end of a sentence like this [@Naman2014]. Alternatively, you may want to refer to a specific study in the text. For example, @LoScerbo2020 is Daniella's recent paper - not about salmon, but still looks really cool. To cite multiple references, separate them with a semi-colon [@Bailey2020; @LoScerbo2020].

#Methods
If you are doing anything mathy, writing in Rmarkdown is great. You can either use markdown or LaTeX syntax for equations.
Simple math is easy in markdown - just stick it between two dollar signs. You can mix LaTeX syntax in as well for more complexity.

$E = MC^2$

You can also write maths with LaTeX directly. This is handy if you want equations to be auto-numbered. Below is Bayes' theorem as LaTeX. 

\begin{equation}
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \, P(A)}{P(B)}
\end{equation}

#Figures



Let's add the multi-plot figure from Daniella's analysis. Note that the file is in the same directory as the manuscript - this means that if we update the figure in the original script, it automatically updates here.
